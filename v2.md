# Autodeploy v2

# Introduction

This document describes the features coming in version 2 of the application.

# Goals

The main goal of the second version is the ability of deploying to servers which are behind the firewall and not possible for the AutoDeploy-server to access them to run the deployment procedure.
 
# Design

## Requirements

The main requirement is the server will be available over REST API interface for the mid-level servers to check their jobs and execute the deployment jobs
 
 
## New Components

* **Mid Server**: New server (running on nodes behind firewall) will be created to check the central server (which is contacted with Django Web Interface) to see if there are jobs waiting for it. The server will have url of the central server and port number (optional), check interval in minutes and secret token which acts as a password.

## Changes to current components

### Autodeploy-server

* New deployments queue should be implemented to submit the deployment jobs to and then the mid-server will check it.
    * The queue should be saved to resume if the server is crashed for any reason.
* Deployment progress message should be created to know which servers have received their jobs.
* New configuration file should be added to know which mid-servers are out there, and their tokens.

### Web Interfaces

* Adding mid servers to the server should be done by the web interface
    * The interface should be able to generate tokens to the nodes.
* Ability to add servers groups to deploy to a set of servers directly rather than one-by-one deployment.
* Show Deployment status e.g which servers performed the deployment.
* Send an email to the admin when all the servers has received the deployment.
